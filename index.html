                <h3>Expectations</h3>
                <p>I expect to gain a solid foundation in modern web technologies that align with current industry standards. I anticipate that this course will challenge my problem-solving skills through hands-on coding activities and real-world scenarios. Furthermore, I expect to receive constructive feedback that helps me refine my technical abilities and design intuition. I also look forward to a structured learning environment where complex topics are broken down into manageable milestones. Finally, I expect to emerge from this course with a portfolio-ready project that demonstrates my proficiency in creating responsive and accessible websites.</p>

                <h3>Motivations</h3>
                <p>My primary motivation is to build a high-level grasp of future topics that will be directly useful to my long-term career as a developer. I am driven by the desire to master the fundamentals of this course to ensure I have no knowledge gaps in my technical foundation. I am also motivated by the prospect of turning theoretical concepts into functional, interactive applications. Additionally, I want to stay competitive in the fast-evolving tech field by learning the latest best practices. Ultimately, I am motivated to achieve academic excellence while building a professional identity through my work.</p>

                <h3>Contributions</h3>
                <p>I aim to contribute to the learning environment by actively participating in class discussions and sharing my perspective on technical challenges. I plan to support my peers during group activities by offering help with troubleshooting code and clarifying difficult concepts. I will also contribute by maintaining a positive and collaborative attitude in all team-based projects. I intend to share useful resources or tools I discover during my independent study with the rest of the class. Lastly, I will ensure my contributions are always timely and of high quality to help my team succeed.</p>

                <h3>Hindrances</h3>
                <p>A significant hindrance I may face is managing a heavy academic workload alongside personal responsibilities, which can lead to time management issues. I also recognize that technical roadblocks, such as debugging complex logic, can sometimes cause delays in my progress. Fluctuating internet connectivity or hardware limitations could occasionally disrupt my workflow during remote study. I also tend to over-analyze design choices, which can sometimes slow down my development speed. To overcome these, I plan to maintain a strict schedule, prioritize high-impact tasks, and seek help early when I encounter obstacles.</p>
